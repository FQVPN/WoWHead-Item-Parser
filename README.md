The WoWHead Item parser collects the information which WoWHead reveals about an item and brings them into the SQL format of the selected emulator.
With the WoWHead item parser its possible to parse a single item but also a range of items (eg. 60000- 70000).


WoWHead doesnt save all information about an item needed by the emulator but the most important things. 

I also added 2 text files to the archive where you find some special information about which values I cant parse atm.
